# Go Network CLI

This CLI is my version of (Tutorial's edge network cli)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2p0Snwk4gc&list=WL&index=5&ab_channel=TutorialEdge]

## What's so special about this?

I didn't change much of the functionality, actually it still has the same behavior as the one in the video, but I modified the project structure in such a way that it would be able to scale beautifully.

Seperating commands and flags into their own respective files and making a struct for the app instead of having everything in one big chunky file.
